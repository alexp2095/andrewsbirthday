      <h2>2009</h2>
      <article>
        <p>They met back in high school in the year 2009. Alex was a freshman at the time and Andrew was a sophomore. They were both in the same choir class, which you guess it: they enjoyed singing. That's how they met and what started their friendship. Pretty soon they became close friends, constantly talking daily, whether it was through AIM or Facebook. Not only that, but they also hung out in the same group!</p>
        <p>Alex would talk about her boy issues to him, constantly updating him about the next guy she was into. She would also tease Andrew, whether it was through poking or punching. They would even play games together, such as the PSP, Wii, and Nintendo DS. She even begged him to sing to her, which he never gave into until much later. He watched her play, The Laramie Project, and she viewed a musical he starred in titled The Beauty and the Beast. They also performed choir concerts together.</p>
        <p>After a year of friendship, feelings started to develop, something they were both experiencing. She couldn't manage to stay as friends anymore and came up with a decision. Rather than keeping it to herself, Alex eventually worked up the courage to express her feelings to Andrew. During their lunch break, she found him and after a few minutes, finally gathered up the courage to tell him. She gushed, "I like you." Andrew's reaction was in shock and awe, but just as he was about to say his response, she immediately took it back and said, "Just kidding." She left.</p>

      <h2>2012</h2>
      <article>
        <p>Andrew eventually graduated high school in 2012, however it still didn't prevent him from pursuing Alex. He wanted to do anything to maintain that close friendship with her. Because of that, he attended her graduation in 2013, hoping to find her and congratulate her on that special day. Unfortunately, his search was unsuccessful as he couldn't find her that day.</p>
        <p>Even though they both graduated, they still maintained their friendship after high school. She would talk about her trips with the family, while he told her about what was happening with his life. They both attended college, but he realized that it wasn't for him and because of that, he joined the marines in 2013. She was the first one he informed about his life-changing decision and completely supported it.</p>
        <p>However, it still wasn't enough to destroy their friendship. Once he arrived at bootcamp, Andrew constantly sent her hand-written letters as they were the only way of communication. Unfortunately, she never sent one back to him. After bootcamp, he was able to talk to Alex, which is exactly what he did. A year later of talking through Facebook, Skype, and Facetime, she officially titled him her best friend.</p>
        <p>They started talking again, but this time, Alex was telling Andrew about a completely different guy she was talking to and liked. Even though he still liked her, he didn't have the courage to tell her and kept it to himself. Trying to be a good best friend, he listened to what she said, no matter how much it hurt him. She'd constantly talk to him about all the details that was happening with this guy and even thought he was the one. As her feelings for him were starting to grow, his would get more hurt.</p>

          <h2>2015</h2>
          <article>
        <p>Eventually a year passes, and the guy Alex was into falls apart. Andrew finally realized that this was his chance to tell her how he truly felt, and he did. However, her feelings for him weren't as mutual and unfortunately didn't reciprocate them. She told him that she just wanted to just be best friends and for him to move on. Of course, he took it to heart and did just that.</p>
        <p>Andrew eventually finds himself a girlfriend, but still always managed to find himself talking to Alex. Despite the new girlfriend, their friendship still grew strong. Now it was his turn to inform her about what was occurring in his love life and how happy he was with her. He would tell her how much in love he was with her. Alex was truly happy that he was enjoying his relationship. He'd tell her about their issues they experienced as a couple, which she always listened to and gave advice to. Like every couple, they eventually hit a rocky road, which led to their break up. Playing the role of a best friend as she can, she tried to get him back to his feet.</p>

      <h2>2016</h2>
      <article>
    <p>Another year passes, and Alex is gossiping to Andrew about another new guy she found. Of course, it hurts him, but he does his best to move on and find other potential. He started to talk to other girls as well, hoping that it would fill the gap of the hole in his heart. They were still able to maintain their friendship, whether it was about games or the  most random topics. Out of the blue, she decided that she wanted to give Andrew a chance. When she told him about her decision, he was dumbfounded, yet thrilled at the same time that his long-lasting love was finally returning his feelings. Unfortunately, she failed to keep her promise and instead remained best friends.</p>
    <p>Then one day, Alex told Andrew she found herself a boyfriend at school. She informed him all the details of how they met and how they got together. The news devastated him, since this was her first major boyfriend. Even though she had a boyfriend, they kept talking. Even if he was talking to other women, they weren't even as close to her. She constantly posted pictures of the two of them all over social media, which hurt him. He kept telling her about how he felt towards her to the point that she was okay with it.</p>
    <p>There was a point, however, when he couldn't talk to her anymore because of the fact of how happy she seemed to be with him. Andrew eventually got a girlfriend as well and Alex was supportive of the two. He truly seemed happy this time as was she. They were both posting pictures of their significant other all over and told each other what was happening. Only this time, their friendship was starting to dwindle with just a few occasional 'hello' or 'how are you?' They were both growing up from the people they used to be before and accepted the fact that they were moving on from each other.</p>

    <h2>2017</h2>
    <article>
      <p>A year into Alex's relationship, Andrew's was unfortunately not as lucky as her and ended after a few months. He tried to move on to other girls to heal what happened. Sadly, their friendship was just as stale. She would at times out of the blue update him about her boyfriend and what they were doing. He'd do the same and told her about a few girls he was interested in. However, he was enjoying his single life, trying to move on from Alex.</p>
      <p>Then it got quiet...</p>

    <h2>2018</h2>
    <article>
      <p>Alex's relationship inevitably reached two years, her longest yet and was beyond thrilled to announce it to Andrew, who was still single. At this point, he was finally able to accept her boyfriend. He had to. Since they were together for this long, Andrew came to terms that they might get engaged, or even worse, married. Even though the idea killed him, he had to keep up the facade and so he did. At this point, he was able to be happy for her. Their friendship started to revitalize again for the first time after the silence of two years. She was happy and that's all he wanted for her, even if it meant seeing her walk down the aisle with someone else.</p>
    <p>Alex graduated college a few months after Andrew got discharged from the Marines. He did everything he could to attend her special day, but unfortunately wasn't able to. Alex and her boyfriend graduated together, finally being able to take on the world. All their friends, classmates, and professors were happy for them that they got through it together. And they did just that. They spent the whole summer together, whether it was hanging out at the city or attending conventions.</p>
    <p>Andrew and Alex's friendship were starting to dwindle again to the point that they barely talking to each other. He was able to be support her relationship. At times, he even invited the three of them to hang out together. Andrew was finally able to move on from his long-lasting love. They were just best friends and that's all they were ever going to be, something he was able to accept.</p>

    <p>After the summer was over, Andrew got a message on Messenger, which stated, "He broke up with me." Confused and perplexed by the message, he decided to check who it was from. It was from Alex. He couldn't wrap his mind over what she said and so, being the best friend that he was, asked her, "What happened?" She told him the general story of what happened and asked if he could come to hear her side. And so, he did.</p>
    <p>Andrew drove to her house as fast as he could to comfort his best friend. He rang the doorbell and there she was, his best friend since high school. She had shorter lighter hair, different from her usual long black hair she always had in high school. He was manlier with a chiseled figure, which was unlike his skinny body. She greeted, "Hey it's been awhile," and strode to him to give him a hug. Just like that, their friendship started to come alive again.</p>
    <p>Alex gestured him to sit next to her on the couch, so he followed suit. She couldn't help, but stare at how different he appeared, not only his appearance, but personality as well. He thought the same thing she was. She eventually started to cry, while telling him exactly what happened and their plans for the future, like having promise rings for each other. He listened to her every word with intensity to help her calm down.</p>
    <p>However, his attempts were unsuccessful, so he hugged her and pulled her closer to him. Alex was shocked as to why he was hugging her and struggled to let him go. She eventually gave in and finally held him too, while crying in his arms. To stop her from crying, he finally had the courage to kiss her lips after all these years. At first, she pulled away, but inevitably kissed him back.</p>

    <h2>Happy Ever After</h2>
    <article>
      <p>Ever since that day, she experienced something she never felt before. She fell in love with her best friend for 10 years and she couldn't have been happier. Alex learned how Andrew felt about her all these years. She finally returned his feelings for her after all this time. Andrew had been in love with her this whole time, but she merely disregarded it as infatuation, never realizing until now how he was right all along. It was true love.</p>
      <p>They officially became a couple that day. Alex finally learned to fall in love with her best friend. She was finally happy as was he. They did what every normal couple experienced, like pumpkin carving, going to the city, visiting a museum, attending conventions, riding rollercoasters, and of course eating funnel cake. They were both finally happy. However, there were bumps in the road, but it didn't stop them. It only made them stronger. The longer they were together, the more they realized how similar they were. They both liked Disney, grilled onions on their burgers, the crunchy part, sweets, blue, husky dogs, nighttime, and even the same kind of ice cream.</p>
      <p> The two were inseparable, constantly wanting to be by each other's side. They were finally experiencing an inexplicable emotion neither have experienced before.</p>
      <p>Andrew and Alex have finally found the one they've been searching for and lived happily ever after.</p>
